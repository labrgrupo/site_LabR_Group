### [**Embracing the R Programming Language: A Future-Oriented Tool for Clinical Laboratories**]{style="color:darkblue"}

<br>

The article titled [**Why Clinical Laboratorians Should Embrace the R Programming Language**](https://www.aacc.org/cln/articles/2020/april/why-clinical-laboratorians-should-embrace-the-r-programming-language), published on the **AACC's website in 2020**, emphasizes the importance of the R programming language for clinical laboratories. As the reliance on data analysis increases, clinical laboratories are generating, processing, and storing transactional data with a high level of quality and efficiency. These data are not only essential for patient care and quality assurance activities but are also increasingly being used to guide operational decisions.\

The article argues that the R programming language is ideal for clinical laboratories due to its open, platform-independent, and free nature, as well as having a massive, global user and contributor base. Applications of R in medicine are growing due to the increasing visibility of R's versatility and the availability of relevant, focused training.\

R is highly customizable, reproducible, and can be automated. It is widely used for its graphic and reporting capabilities, including the ability to render publication-quality figures with interactivity and generate web-based dashboards and other reports in a variety of formats.\

The article also discusses how to start programming with R, the five key attributes of R, examples of R applications in clinical laboratories, and resources for new R programmers. In addition, the article emphasizes that they believe that clinical laboratories will require increasing use of data analytics to optimize operations, manage utilization, and provide improved interpretation of complex laboratory data in the context of patients' medical records.\

The review article titled [**"Data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning: Opportunities for laboratory medicine and the value of positive regulation"**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009912018311974?via%3Dihub) was penned by Damien Gruson and Thibault Helleputte, and published in the **Clinical Biochemistry journal in the year 2019**.\

The article delves into how data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are unlocking new opportunities for laboratory medicine. With the increasing amount and diversity of data that healthcare professionals are exposed to, these technologies prove useful for the holistic interpretation of this information.\

In this scenario, machine learning algorithms require three main ingredients: learning algorithms, computational power, and data. With the advancement of technology, we now have access to a vast amount of patient data, immense computational power, and well-developed learning algorithms.\

With the development of cloud computing infrastructures, several machine learning frameworks have been proposed for the growing number of non-data scientists. However, for relevant and robust results, it is best to rely on custom approaches designed and implemented by experts.\  

The complexity of laboratory processes and the challenges associated with their integration into care pathways are evident. Data science can help overcome these challenges and improve the efficiency of health processes. However, translating data science and AI into daily practices presents several challenges, including the collection and sharing of data with potentially sensitive information. This has raised major concerns about privacy.\

**Key 1 - Patient information and consent:** The patient must be informed before the use of any AI technology in the course of their care. The AI device should not replace the collection of patient consent.  

**Key 2 - AI human warranty:** The principle of AI human warranty in health should be respected. This warranty should be ensured by the regular verification of the management options proposed by the AI device.  

**Key 3 - Graduation of regulation according to the level of sensitivity of health data**: In accordance with the principles of bioethics law, the regulation of the implementation of an AI device for the processing of large amounts of health data should be graduated according to the sensitivity of these data.  

**Key 4 - Accompaniment of the adaptation of health professions:** The implementation of data science-based devices for data processing or robotics will require the adaptation of health professions.  

**Key 5 - Need for independent guidance:** An independent guidance group should be implemented to examine the efforts made to promote the four keys outlined above.

Data science and AI present significant challenges, including technical, legal, financial, and ethical challenges. However, these challenges can be overcome through technical developments, such as distributed learning, and the implementation of positive regulations. Data science has the potential to transform laboratory medicine and improve the efficiency of health processes.
